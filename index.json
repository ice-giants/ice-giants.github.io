When ESA called for science themes for its L2 and L3 missions in 2013 (€1bn), the community responded with proposals for Uranus (Arridge et al., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2014.08.009), Neptune (Masters et al., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2014.05.008), entry probes (Mousis et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00235), and missions to both worlds (Turrini et al., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2014.09.005). Although L2 (2031) and L3 (2034) were awarded to the ATHENA X-ray telescope and LISA gravitational wave observatory, respectively, this effort from the European community culminated in the ESA Senior Survey Committee stating (2013): “Study of the icy giants to be a theme of very high science quality and perfectly fitting the criteria for an L-class mission…. recommends that every effort is made to pursue this theme through other means, such as cooperation on missions led by partner agencies.”\n US-ESA Ice Giants Study 2016-2017: the positive perspectives emerging from the L2/L3 competition led to European involvement in the NASA-led ice giants Science Definition Team (SDT) study in 2016-17 (Adam Masters and Diego Turrini). This study took a fresh look at science priorities and concepts for missions to the Uranus and Neptune systems, assessing and prioritising science objectives considering advances since the last US Decadal Survey, current and emerging technologies, mission implementation techniques, and celestial mechanics. This study examined a wide range of mission architectures, flight elements, and notional science instruments. The SDT recommended an orbiter-probe mission to either Uranus or Neptune (~$2bn USD), or both planets ($3-4bn USD). The executive summary of the report can be found here: https://www.lpi.usra.edu/icegiants/mission_study/Exec-Summary.pdf\n ESA Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study: In 2018-19, ESA explored potential means of participation in a NASA-led mission to the ice giants, looking at a palette of potential “stand alone” configurations of varying complexity and clean interfaces. The study looked at atmospheric probes, a potential second orbiter that relies on the cruise stage to Jupiter and then departs, and a Triton lander study. The first CDF study report is available here (https://sci.esa.int/web/future-missions-department/-/61307-cdf-study-report-ice-giants), with the second expected imminently.\n ESA Voyage 2050: In March 2019, ESA released a call for scientific themes as part of a long-term planning process to replace the Cosmic Vision (2015-2035). Known as Voyage 2050, this would develop a strategy for the 2035-2050 period. White papers were due on August 5th, 2019, to be followed by a presentation to the community in Madrid, October 29-31 2019. Although the Ice Giant community would prefer to see the start of Ice Giant mission long before 2035, this provided the community with an opportunity to make the case for missions to Uranus and Neptune. Three relevant white papers were submitted, describing the transformative planetary science that can only be delivered via a robotic mission to these distant worlds, and the broader context within astronomy and fundamental physics. Leigh Fletcher and Olivier Mousis will both present their white papers to the committee in Madrid on October 29th: a. Fletcher et al. - Ice Giant Systems (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02963) b. Mousis et al. – in situ probes (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00917) c. Guillot – Hydrogen Atmospheres (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02092)\n NASA Planetary Mission Pre-decadal Concept Studies 2019: In preparation for the 2023 Planetary Science Decadal Survey, NASA solicited proposals to conduct mission concept studies in planetary science. These studies would have a fast turn-around once the successful teams are announced (expected imminently), with the aim of providing study reports once the decadal survey panels are set up in 2020. At least six proposals were submitted as follow-on to the 2016-17 NASA SDT study that are of relevance to the Ice Giants, with a small number investigating what could be accomplished at the level of a $1bn New-Frontiers class of mission, rather than a $2-3bn flagship. The outcomes of these studies will inform the decadal survey panels, although it was noted that the Decadal Survey committee may commission further studies where necessary to inform the decision process. The recommendations of the US Decadal survey will be made available by early 2022.\n ESA Council of Ministers (CMIN19): ESA’s Senior Committee had already identified the Ice Giants as an important science theme for a large mission. The 2018-19 ESA studies were requested by the Mission Studies Office (SCI-FM) in the Future Missions Department of ESA\u0026rsquo;s Science Directorate. The resulting possible ESA contribution to a US-led mission, known as the M* mission (M-class mission budget proposed following the removal of the M6 Cosmic Vision Programme Call), is one of a set of high-priority options to be proposed to ESA’s Council of Ministers meeting (Space19+) in Sevilla, Spain, on 27 – 28 November 2019. In order to maintain Europe’s global leadership, ESA’s Science Programme (led by Gunther Hasinger, Director of Science) is asking via its DG for a substantial rise in funding of scientific activities over 4 years (of about 20%) at Space19+. This may allow ESA to operate ATHENA and LISA close together, and could also allow ESA to initiate studies for the contribution to the Ice Giants mission. The outcome of the budget request, and allocations to specific missions, could be known in early 2020.\n OPAG (Outer Planets Assessment Group): In August 2019, Dr. Lori Glaze, Director of NASA\u0026rsquo;s Planetary Science Division, requested planetary science Assessment/Analysis Groups (\u0026ldquo;AGs\u0026rdquo;) to suggest priority big science questions to be considered in the upcoming US Decadal Survey. These priority questions are important because, after the questions are vetted by the decadal survey panels, they may serve as the basis of proposals written in the coming decade. Furthermore, white paper responses to the decadal should be careful to address these big-science questions. The OPAG response to this request is available here: https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/aug2019/OPAG-ScienceLetter-to-Glaze_27Aug19.pdf\n Critical Timelines: Both the NASA and ESA studies confirmed the critical timescale for a proposed Ice Giant mission: in order to maximise the delivered mass to the system, a Jupiter gravity assist would be required. This leads to preferential launch windows in 2029-30 for Neptune or 2030-34 for Uranus using conventional launch capabilities. If we miss these opportunities, then the next ones are in the mid 2040s. Given that ESA’s senior survey panel (2013) ranked ice giant science extremely highly, and the US decadal survey ranked an ice giant mission as a 3rd priority (after Mars 2020 and Europa, both of which are well under way), it was noted that an ice giant mission should start as soon as possible to meet launch opportunities at the end of the next decade. Some concerns were expressed over waiting until the culmination of the 2022-23 decadal survey process, as “leaving it too late.”\n Mission Destination: Brief discussions about the ultimate choice of destination (Uranus, Neptune, or both) led to the conclusion that, whichever is ultimately chosen for technical/programmatic reasons, the entire community should get behind this decision. Whilst both targets have high value and significant scientific potential (Uranus for its extreme behaviour and natural satellite system, Neptune for the presence of Triton), it was noted that both systems could be harbouring “Ocean Worlds.”\n US Decadal Survey White Papers: The next step in the Ice Giant mission advocacy programme is to consolidate behind a small number of high-quality white papers to be submitted to the US decadal survey. Given the expected volume of submissions, it was felt that a smaller number with numerous co-authors and endorsers would have a stronger impact. A tentative list of white papers is available here, with rough drafts to be prepared by mid-October (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vpafk79WyoMx7OtybDvNa7DzhFPGe8PeAaCoYdfvOCg/htmlview) – although note that the call for white papers might change the style and substance of these. To get involved, it was requested that people contact the lead authors directly. There was discussion about the value of a European-led white paper for the US survey, showcasing ESA’s Ice Giants interests and capabilities – those interested to contact leigh.fletcher@le.ac.uk.\n Royal Society Ice Giant Systems Workshop: Registration and abstract submission are open for the international meeting in London, January 20th-22nd 2020. Please see https://ice-giants.github.io/ for full details, where the plenary speakers (and their topics) are listed for the Monday and Tuesday. We invite abstracts on topics relevant to Ice Giant science, to be presented either as orals on Wednesday 22nd January, or as posters on Monday 20th January. Note that registration is mandatory and limited in numbers, with a small fee to cover catering for the Wednesday Splinter meetings. The closing deadline will be during the AGU meeting in December, so please plan ahead. Please contact ice-giants@le.ac.uk if you have any questions.\n  How can I get involved? This was a common question after the splinter meeting, and given that we’re at the stage of mission advocacy, there’s no well-defined route. Within ESA, we need lobbying at national level, making sure that civil servants are up to date with the Ice Giant mission concepts, so that they can pass it up the chain to government ministers. In the US, people are encouraged to engage with OPAG and with the upcoming white paper process, but similar advocacy and engagement is required. The generational timescales involved in an Ice Giant mission requires involvement from all career stages, and the community must think of ways of enhancing the opportunities for early-career scientists in these long-term missions.\n","date":1569872356,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569872356,"objectID":"9399a59030e6c0cc5a49d6679755d25c","permalink":"https://ice-giants.github.io/post/epsc-dps2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-30T20:39:16+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/epsc-dps2019/","section":"post","summary":"Minutes of the EPSC-DPS 2019 Ice Giants Splinter in Geneva.","tags":[],"title":"EPSC-DPS 2019 Ice Giant Splinter","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Dear Colleagues,\nRegistration and abstract submission for the Ice Giant Systems 2020 conference, hosted by London’s prestigious Royal Society, are now open.

The ice giant community met on Wednesday afternoon to focus on the exploration of Uranus and Neptune, from their interiors, to their atmospheres, magnetospheres, rings and satellite systems. Unusual for the COSPAR symposia, the organisers split the time between standard oral presentations and a workshop-style discussion forum on international collaboration for a future ice giant mission. Both sections were well received and fostered interesting discussions between conference delegates for the remainder of the COSPAR meeting.\nNew Scientific Results The ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, have been visited only once by a robotic spacecraft (Voyager 2 in 1986 and 1989, respectively). Many of the most recent insights into how these unusual systems work are therefore the result of Earth-based observations, both from ground-based observatories and space telescopes. Hoftstadter et al. contrasted radio-wave observations of Saturn and Uranus from facilities like the Very Large Array (VLA), explaining how spectral models are used to explore the deep abundances of ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and (potentially) water within these worlds. The existing Uranus data sensing the atmospheric composition can be explained by approximately solar abundances of these heavy materials, raising the question of how the materials might be trapped within their deeper interiors. Wong et al. described Hubble Space Telescope observations of a new dark oval that formed on Neptune in 2015, not dissimilar from the Great Dark Spot observed by Voyager in 1989. This oval has been re-observed several times since 2015 as it drifted southwards, whereas most drift equatorward. Its bright companion clouds have become more centred within the vortex, and Wong’s team plans to track its continued evolution in the coming years.\nObservations at mid-infrared wavelengths, sensing the atmospheric temperatures and composition of Uranus and Neptune, featured significantly for the rest of the symposium, largely as a result of preparation for the expected slew of data from the James Webb Space Telescope, due for launch in 2021. Orton et al. presented images of Uranus at wavelengths sensing stratospheric emission from acetylene gas. This provides a capability inaccessible to Voyager – the ability to probe the circulation of Uranus’ stratosphere. The results, from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Gemini Observatory, indicate an unusual circulation pattern that localises the stratospheric emission to Uranus’ poles at the time of the 2007 equinox. Fletcher et al. followed this up in a subsequent talk using spatially-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy of Uranus, which is extremely challenging from Earth but whets the appetite for future data from the MIRI 5-28 µm instrument on JWST, which will provide the first spatially-resolved spectra at these wavelengths. Fletcher also presented VLT observations of Neptune, characterising stratospheric temperatures within its warm polar vortex during Neptune’s southern summertime conditions. Sinclair et al. presented further stratospheric imaging of Neptune from the VLT, correlating diffuse warm regions in the stratosphere with cloud activity observed in the troposphere. Finally, a poster by Rowe-Gurney et al. explored longitudinal variability observed in Spitzer Space Telescope disc-averaged spectra of Uranus, but not Neptune, hinting at unexpected dynamic variability on a world usually thought of as stagnant and inactive.\nThe scientific presentations continued with Masters et al. explaining how the processes governing ice giant magnetospheres might be rather different from those at work on the gas giants, presenting models indicating the important role of a viscous-like interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. Kirchoff et al. contrasted impact cratering size distributions on the Uranian satellites with those on Jupiter and Saturn, advocating future exploration of these terrains. And Mandt et al. concluded the scientific discussion by exploring how measurements of the deuterium and nitrogen content of Triton’s atmosphere could prove crucial in understanding the origin of volatiles on distant worlds, including Pluto.\nFuture Exploration The final hour of the symposium shifted into a discussion of future international collaboration on missions to the ice giants, hosted by Hoftstadter, Simon and Fletcher. Hofstadter reported the primary outcomes of the 2016-17 NASA-ESA Science Definition Team study, which concluded in 2017 with an extensive report (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/icegiants/mission_study/). Simon described a recent white paper advocating a two-mission concept, combining a Uranus flyby with a KBO mission, alongside a dedicated Neptune-Triton orbital mission (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08769). It was stressed that this was one of many potential ice giant exploration strategies, and concepts for Uranus orbital exploration were also discussed. There was discussion of the criticality of planetary entry probes (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00235), combined with orbital remote sensing in the infrared and microwave, in order to explore the chemical composition of Uranus and Neptune for comparisons with other targets in the solar system.\nSeveral ideas were raised during the wide-ranging discussion, including the need to identify and develop key enabling technologies for future ice giant missions, and how to ensure that ice giant science remained at the top of the agenda in the US Decadal Survey, ESA’s Cosmic Vision, and within the sites of other space agencies. Particular attention focussed on how to open up the US medium-class missions (New Frontiers) to allow for ice giant exploration and on starting a new large-class mission before the next Decadal review. Given the breadth of ideas, and the timescale for the next US decadal and future potential ESA studies, it was suggested that a dedicated ice giant workshop be held in 2019, to be used as a focal point for the development of topical white papers. The discussion section was warmly received, and we would encourage similar events be worked into the programme for future COSPAR symposia.\n","date":1531950653,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531950653,"objectID":"fb76795dde4fb7db0dac9d44a7a964e2","permalink":"https://ice-giants.github.io/post/cospar-ice-giants-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-18T21:50:53Z","relpermalink":"/post/cospar-ice-giants-2018/","section":"post","summary":"Report on the Ice Giants session at COSPAR 2018.","tags":[],"title":"COSPAR Ice Giants 2018","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"NASA is required to conduct decadal surveys by law, and is also required to conduct midterm assessments of their progress toward meeting the goals of the decadal survey. The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 (NRC, 2011), was released in March 2011. In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published the Visions into Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022: A Midterm Review (https://doi.org/10.17226/25186).\nThe report points out that the third prioritised large strategic (flagship)-class mission in Vision and Voyages was a Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission (after Mars and Europa missions), but that this has not yet been initiated. The choice of Uranus over Neptune was for practical reasons (trajectories, flight times, and cost), as opposed to scientific ones — the decadal survey committee stated that both ice giants and their moons are equally scientifically interesting.\nThey confirmed that \u0026ldquo;the notional ice giants mission described in Vision and Voyages would address a broad range of ice giant science objectives using mature instrumentation. The objectives of the mission concept described in a NASA-sponsored 2017 ice giants study have been changed significantly from the original Vision and Voyages science objectives. The committee found that the scientific payload proposed in the study carries significant risk of failing to make the measurements proposed in Vision and Voyages. New objectives were proposed in the ice giants study. The mission concept is ambitious in investigating the interior structure of an ice giant using a Doppler imager, analogous to undertaking helioseismological investigations of the Sun. This approach at any giant planet, including ice giants, is currently unproven theoretically or experimentally. If this component of the mission were not successful scientifically, a large part of the revised science objectives would be degraded or lost.\u0026rdquo; The report therefore recommended that \u0026ldquo;NASA should perform a new mission study based on the original ice giants science objectives identified in Vision and Voyages to determine if a more broad-based set of science objectives can be met within a $2 billion cost cap.\u0026rdquo;\nThe report also highlighted some of the technology needs for future ice giant missions, ranging from aerocapture, Advanced solar arrays, Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs), and next-generation electric propulsion, Next Generation Optical Communications, High-temperature electronic packaging for extreme environments, and heat-shield technology for planetary entry and sample return. Ice giant missions require nuclear power because of their tremendous distances from the Sun. NASA has now focused its nuclear power technology development on an enhanced MMRTG, and is proceeding with a technology decision planned in 2019.\nThe next US decadal survey in planetary science is expected to commence in the early 2020s, and with the Mars and Europa elements of the previous decade well underway, it is hoped that the long-awaited flagship-level mission to Uranus or Neptune may finally begin in earnest.\n","date":1523900826,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523900826,"objectID":"d9401f1bd96b5c458d17ff4638fedc3e","permalink":"https://ice-giants.github.io/post/decadal-midterm2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T18:47:06+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/decadal-midterm2018/","section":"post","summary":"A 2018 progress report on the US Planetary Decadal Survey","tags":[],"title":"Visions to Voyages:  Decadal Survey Mid-Term Review","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Exoplanet Science Strategy White Paper Rymer et al., 2018\nLink to white paper\nSubmitted to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, Space Studies Board\nFuture remote sensing of exoplanets will be enhanced by a thorough investigation of our solar system Ice Giants (Neptune-size planets). What can the configuration of the magnetic field tell us (remotely) about the interior, and what implications does that field have for the structure of the magnetosphere; energy input into the atmosphere, and surface geophysics (for example surface weathering of satellites that might harbour sub-surface oceans). How can monitoring of auroral emission help inform future remote observations of emission from exoplanets? Our Solar System provides the only laboratory in which we can perform in-situ experiments to understand exoplanet formation, dynamos, systems and magnetospheres.\nWithin the past decade it has been realized that Neptune-size planets are among the most common class of exoplanet in our galaxy, [Fulton et al., 2017]. In situ study of an Ice Giant will enable numerous investigations that, despite several decades of study, are still not fully understood. These include the following top-level questions that have direct relevance to exoplanets:\n Auroral configuration and emission - unlike our Solar System, eccentric and complex orbital characteristics appear to be common in other planetary systems, so that the understanding of radio emission produced by Uranus could have profound importance for interpreting future radio detections of exoplanets.\n Magnetospheric Transport/Atmospheric Energy Deposition - mechanisms for plasma transport and diffusion, that are well understood at other planets, have never been studied in this type of geometry.\n Radiation Belts (Energetic Particle Trapping) - how stable are the Uranian radiation belts? Are they always present? Can we guide the search for exoplanets with magnetic fields by identifying which of them have radiation belts?\n Bulk Composition and Internal Structure - understanding the composition and structure of our Solar System’s ice giants is a necessary prerequisite to identifying them around other stars from the minimal information available (such as mass and radius), and recognizing if those exoplanetary systems contain a type of planet not seen in our Solar System.\n Intrinsic magnetic field - understanding the dynamos of our solar system, we would be able to predict the magnetic field strengths and morphologies of exoplanetary dynamos with more confidence.\n  ","date":1520631030,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520631030,"objectID":"d65a7609f85be0f2425fc070019d8730","permalink":"https://ice-giants.github.io/post/exoplanets-ice-giants/","publishdate":"2018-03-09T21:30:30Z","relpermalink":"/post/exoplanets-ice-giants/","section":"post","summary":"Exploring the connection between Ice Giants and exoplanets.","tags":[],"title":"Exoplanets in our Backyard","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The Ice Giants Study was commissioned by NASA to take a fresh look at science priorities and concepts for missions to the Uranus and Neptune systems in preparation for the third Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

The audience was composed of about 90 scientists and engineers from 12 countries, interested in the study of this unique planetary system.\nPurpose of Meeting The purpose of the meeting was to review the current knowledge of Uranus from past measurements, to highlight recent advances and ongoing studies on this planetary environment, and summarise the important unsolved scientific questions together with the key measurements required to address them. The meeting culminated in a discussion of the status of future international mission concepts in Europe and in the United States to explore the Uranus System, including updates on feasibility studies and available technologies, together with next Earth-based observing campaigns. The conclusions of the meeting are available to download here.\nThe format of the conference consisted of review and contributed talks on the interior and origins of Uranus, its system of rings and satellites, its atmosphere and ionosphere, its magnetic field and magnetosphere, and on the exploration of the outer heliosphere, with dedicated time for discussion and synthesis. The full abstract book is available here.\nMeeting outcomes The scientific and instrumental presentations made clear that Uranus is a top-level priority for several scientific fields. Its extreme planetary, magnetospheric, and heliospheric environments will bring \u0026lsquo;L-class\u0026rsquo; science return in our understanding of fundamental processes operating in our Solar System and beyond. The crucial measurements needed to achieve the study of this system deserve an ambitious space mission, supported by complementary Earth-based observations. With the exception of Neptune, located twice as far away, Uranus remains the only planet not explored by a dedicated orbiting spacecraft. It thus stands as the next step for exploring the solar system, as witnessed by numerous Uranus mission concepts recently proposed to NASA, ESA and CNES calls.\nAs a community, we strongly support a mission toward Uranus, for which we highly recommend:\n A spacecraft to be planned within the 2020-2030 decade, operating along an orbital tour designed to adequately sample the Uranian environment, with short polar orbits and repeated flybys of the main moons (especially Miranda and Ariel);\n An atmospheric probe and/or aerocapture trajectory to complement remote sensing with in situ measurements;\n and an instrumental payload adequate to fulfil the above key science objectives.\n  Immediate next steps require:\n Feasibility studies to retire risks and develop required technologies for such a mission (phase 0 studies, power supplies such as Radioiosotope Thermoelectric Generators, propulsions modes, optimization of heliospheric measurements during the cruise phase, improved data compression techniques, optimization of telemetry …) ;\n An examination of useful collaborations between national and international space agencies (in particular, lay the groundwork for a multi-agency, Cassini-class Uranus orbiter).\n  Organising committee Scientific program : N.

These missions are planned for launch in 2028 and 2034, respectively, and represent European investments of approximately €1 billion.\nDespite the recently-selected Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) being developed for the L1 mission (launch in 2022), the planetary science community was urged to actively participate in this call. There was no shortage of exciting, ambitious and ground-breaking ideas for the exploration of our solar system, addressing themes and questions right at the heart of ESA\u0026rsquo;s Cosmic Vision. A whole raft of white papers were submitted, several of which were presented at a community meeting in Paris. Ultimately, an X-ray astronomy mission (ATHENA) and a gravitational wave observatory (LISA) were selected as the cornerstone science themes, but the European Ice Giant community were provided with valuable feedback to continue to seek an international mission to these distant worlds.\nSenior Survey Committee Report The 2013 report of ESA\u0026rsquo;s Senior Survey Committee stated:\n\u0026ldquo;In situ exploration of the icy giant planets would bring major advances in our understanding of these worlds in several respects. First, the study of their internal structure (through radio science, accelerometery and, ideally, a measurement of elemental abundances through mass spectrometry aboard a probe), as well as a study of their satellite properties, could provide key diagnostics concerning the history of these systems. Second, an in-depth study of their atmospheres, ionospheres and magnetospheres, as well as their rings and satellites, will help us understand the physico-chemical processes at work in these two systems. Ideally, comparative planetology could be achieved from similar observations performed on both planets and their environments.\nAfter the success of the Cassini mission, and after the selection of an exploration mission toward the Jovian system, the exploration of the icy giants appears to be a timely milestone, fully appropriate for an L class mission. The whole planetology community would be involved in the various aspects of this mission, including physics of the interior, atmospheric and surface sciences, plasmas physics and dynamics. Several mission concepts could be considered, including orbiters and probes, and would need to be investigated in the next stage.\nThe SSC considered the study of the icy giants to be a theme of very high science quality and perfectly fitting the criteria for an L-class mission. However, in view of the competition with a range of other high quality science themes, and despite its undoubted quality, on balance and taking account of the wide array of themes, the SSC does not recommend this theme for L2 or L3. Iview of its importance, however, the SSC recommends that every effort is made to pursue this theme through other means, such as cooperation on missions led by partner agencies.\u0026rdquo;\nWhite papers relevant to the Ice Giants included:\nThe Science Case for an Orbital Mission to Uranus: Exploring the Origins of Ice Giant Planets Arridge et al. (2014)\nLink to White Paper\nGiant planets helped to shape the conditions we see in the Solar System today and they account for more than 99% of the mass of the Sun\u0026rsquo;s planetary system. They can be subdivided into the Ice Giants (Uranus and Neptune) and the Gas Giants (Jupiter and Saturn), which differ from each other in a number of fundamental ways. Uranus, in particular is the most challenging to our understanding of planetary formation and evolution, with its large obliquity, low self-luminosity, highly asymmetrical internal field, and puzzling internal structure. Uranus also has a rich planetary system consisting of a system of inner natural satellites and complex ring system, five major natural icy satellites, a system of irregular moons with varied dynamical histories, and a highly asymmetrical magnetosphere. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have explored Uranus, with a flyby in 1986, and no mission is currently planned to this enigmatic system. However, a mission to the uranian system would open a new window on the origin and evolution of the Solar System and would provide crucial information on a wide variety of physicochemical processes in our Solar System. These have clear implications for understanding exoplanetary systems. In this paper we describe the science case for an orbital mission to Uranus with an atmospheric entry probe to sample the composition and atmospheric physics in Uranus\u0026rsquo; atmosphere. The characteristics of such an orbiter and a strawman scientific payload are described and we discuss the technical challenges for such a mission. This paper is based on a white paper submitted to the European Space Agency\u0026rsquo;s call for science themes for its large-class mission programme in 2013.\nNeptune and Triton: Essential Pieces of the Solar System Puzzle Masters et al. 2014\nThe planet Neptune and its largest moon Triton hold the keys to major advances across multiple fields of Solar System science. The ice giant Neptune played a unique and important role in the process of Solar System formation, has the most meteorologically active atmosphere in the Solar System (despite its great distance from the Sun), and may be the best Solar System analogue of the dominant class of exoplanets detected to date. Neptune׳s moon Triton is very likely a captured Kuiper Belt object, holding the answers to questions about the icy dwarf planets that formed in the outer Solar System. Triton is geologically active, has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere, and is predicted to have a subsurface ocean. However, our exploration of the Neptune system remains limited to a single spacecraft flyby, made by Voyager 2 in 1989. Here, we present the high-level science case for further exploration of this outermost planetary system, based on a white paper submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA) for the definition of the second and third large missions in the ESA Cosmic Vision Programme 2015–2025. We discuss all the major science themes that are relevant for further spacecraft exploration of the Neptune system, and identify key scientific questions in each area. We present an overview of the results of a European-led Neptune orbiter mission analysis. Such a mission has significant scope for international collaboration, and is essential to achieve our aim of understanding how the Solar System formed, and how it works today.\nScientific Rationale for Uranus and Neptune in situ Explorations Mousis et al., 2017\n[Arxiv]\nOriginally part of a Saturn probe white paper.\nThe ice giants Uranus and Neptune are the least understood class of planets in our solar system but the most frequently observed type of exoplanets. Presumed to have a small rocky core, a deep interior comprising ∼70% heavy elements surrounded by a more dilute outer envelope of H2 and He, Uranus and Neptune are fundamentally different from the better-explored gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of the lack of dedicated exploration missions, our knowledge of the composition and atmospheric processes of these distant worlds is primarily derived from remote sensing from Earth-based observatories and space telescopes. As a result, Uranus\u0026rsquo;s and Neptune\u0026rsquo;s physical and atmospheric properties remain poorly constrained and their roles in the evolution of the Solar System not well understood. Exploration of an ice giant system is therefore a high-priority science objective as these systems (including the magnetosphere, satellites, rings, atmosphere, and interior) challenge our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Here we describe the main scientific goals to be addressed by a future in situ exploration of an ice giant. An atmospheric entry probe targeting the 10-bar level, about 5 scale heights beneath the tropopause, would yield insight into two broad themes: i) the formation history of the ice giants and, in a broader extent, that of the Solar System, and ii) the processes at play in planetary atmospheres. The probe would descend under parachute to measure composition, structure, and dynamics, with data returned to Earth using a Carrier Relay Spacecraft as a relay station. In addition, possible mission concepts and partnerships are presented, and a strawman ice-giant probe payload is described. An ice-giant atmospheric probe could represent a significant ESA contribution to a future NASA ice-giant flagship mission.\nThe ODINUS Mission Concept: The Scientific Case for a Mission to the Ice Giant Planets with Twin Spacecrafts to Unveil the History of our Solar System Turrini et al., 2014\nLink to White Paper.\nThe purpose of this document is to discuss the scientific case of a space mission to the ice giants Uranus and Neptune and their satellite systems and its relevance to advance our understanding of the ancient past of the Solar System and, more generally, of how planetary systems form and evolve. As a consequence, the leading theme of this proposal will be the first scientific theme of the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 program: What are the conditions for planetary formation and the emergence of life? In pursuing its goals, the present proposal will also address the second and third scientific theme of the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 program, i.e.: How does the Solar System work? What are the fundamental physical laws of the Universe? The mission concept we will illustrate in the following will be referred to through the acronym ODINUS, this acronym being derived from its main fields of scientific investigation: Origins, Dynamics and Interiors of Neptunian and Uranian Systems. As the name suggests, the ODINUS mission is based on the use of two twin spacecraft to perform the exploration of the ice giants and their regular and irregular satellites with the same set of instruments. This will allow to perform a comparative study of these two systems so similar and yet so different and to unveil their histories and that of the Solar System.\n","date":1363898297,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1363898297,"objectID":"085b9687d652fcf00aa1763db0090d2c","permalink":"https://ice-giants.github.io/post/esa-l2-l3-proposals/","publishdate":"2013-03-21T20:38:17Z","relpermalink":"/post/esa-l2-l3-proposals/","section":"post","summary":"Ice Giant white papers submitted to the Large-Class mission competition.","tags":[],"title":"ESA's Call for Large-Class Mission Themes","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" White Papers Preparation for the \u0026lsquo;Vision and Voyages\u0026rsquo; for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 report required the submission of multiple white papers spanning a range of planetary science themes. A selection relevant to Ice Giant exploration are included below, and all are available here.\n The Atmospheres of the Ice Giants, Uranus and Neptune - Mark Hofstadter: We believe many important atmospheric science questions can only be addressed by studies of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. These questions relate to fundamental atmospheric processes that help us understand the formation, evolution, and current structure of all planets.\n The Exploration of Neptune and Triton - Craig Agnor: Neptune and its captured moon Triton are unexplored with modern spacecraft instrumentation. Observations of these objects are urgently needed to address planet formation and the evolution of ice giant planets, icy satellites, Kuiper Belt Objects, and the solar system itself.\n The Case for a Uranus Orbiter - Mark Hofstadter: This paper discusses some of the fundamental science that must be done at Uranus if we are to understand our Solar System and systems discovered around other stars. We suggest a Uranus Orbiter should be launched in the next decade.\n Entry Probe Missions to the Giant Planets - David Atkinson: It is recommended that probe missions to the giant planets be performed to help constrain models of solar system formation and the origin and evolution of atmospheres, to provide a basis for comparative studies of the gas and ice giants, and to provide a valuable link to extrasolar planetary systems.\n Neptune Science, Neptune Ring Science, Triton Science with Argo - Three White Papers on A Voyage through the Outer Solar System - Candice Hansen: Argo, an innovative concept for a New Frontiers 4 mission, will yield significant advances in our understanding of evolutionary processes of rings and small bodies in the outer Solar System by executing a flyby through the Neptune system, then going on to a scientifically-selected KBO.\n  Survey Findings Chapter 7 of the Decadal Survey included the following conclusions:\n As discussed in this chapter and in the 2003 decadal survey, a comprehensive mission to study one of the ice giants offers enormous potential for new discoveries. The committee investigated missions to both Uranus and Neptune and determined that the two systems offered equally rich science return.\n The Uranus mission is preferred for the decade 2013-2022 both because of the more difficult requirements of achieving Neptune orbit and because of the availability of favorable Uranus trajectories in the coming decade. Risks for a Neptune mission included are risks associated with aerocapture at Neptune, the lack of optimal launch windows for Neptune in the upcoming decade, and long flight times incompatible with the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator [ASRG] system lifetimes.\n The mission studies performed for this decadal survey indicate that it is possible to launch a Uranus mission within the next decade that will insert a fully equipped instrument package into orbit for a multi-year mission to study the atmosphere, rings, magnetic field, and magnetosphere, as well as to deploy a small atmospheric in situ probe and conduct a tour of the larger satellites.\n A Uranus mission will permit in-depth study of a class of planets glimpsed only briefly during a flyby mission carrying 1970s-era technology. Moreover, much of the risk associated with this mission can be retired by studies of the ASRG power systems and proper preparations for probe entry.\n  Uranus Mission objectives High-Priority Science Objectives  Determine the atmospheric zonal winds, composition, and structure at high spatial resolution, as well as the temporal evolution of atmospheric dynamics.\n Understand the basic structure of the planet’s magnetosphere as well as the high-order structure and temporal evolution of the planet’s interior dynamo.\n  Medium-Priority Science Objectives  Determine the noble gas abundances (helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) and isotopic ratios of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in the planet’s atmosphere and the atmospheric structure at the probe descent location.\n Determine internal mass distribution.\n Determine the horizontal distribution of atmospheric thermal emission, as well as the upper-atmospheric thermal structure and changes with time and location at low resolution.\n Determine the geology, geophysics, surface composition, and interior structure of large satellites.\n  Low-Priority Science Objectives  Measure the magnetic field, plasma, and currents to determine how the tilted/offset/rotating magnetosphere interacts with the solar wind over time.\n Determine the composition, structure, particle-size distribution, dynamical stability, and evolutionary history of the rings, as well as the geology, geophysics, and surface composition of small satellites.\n Determine the vertical profile of zonal winds as a function of depth in the atmosphere, in addition to the presence of clouds as a function of depth in the atmosphere.\n  Mission Concept studies Uranus and Neptune Orbiter and Probe Concept Studies, final report.. Led by William Hubbard (Uranus lead), Mark Marley (Neptune lead), along with Heidi Hammel (panel chair), Amy Simon (vice-chair), Krishan Khurana, Brigette Hesman and John Clarke (panel members). Some of the outcomes of this study are summarised in an excellent blog post by Van Kane from 2013. From the executive summary:\nThe purpose of the study was to define a preferred concept approach along with the risk/cost trade space for a Uranus or Neptune Mission launched in the 2020–2023 time frame and within a cost range of $1.5B–$1.9B in FY15$. Initial energy trades identified Uranus as more accessible and a lower risk option within the specified launch time frame, and work on a Neptune option was dropped by the panel after a couple of weeks into the study. Since a Jupiter flyby option was not available during the launch years studied, a Neptune mission would have required unproven aerocapture technology or a cruise time well beyond 15 years. A low-thrust solar electric propulsion trajectory option was developed to Uranus based on a single Earth gravity assist that could be repeated every year with a 21-day launch window. Using a launch on an Atlas V 531 and allowing a 13-year cruise time, a concept was developed that could accommodate both the floor and enhanced orbiter payload, perform atmospheric science with a fully equipped shallow entry probe, and perform multiple targeted flybys of each of the five Uranian satellites. No new technology was required with the exception of continued development of large parasol solar arrays (similar to Orion) to power the solar electric propulsion stage.\nCost for the full mission (with enhanced payload, probe, and tour) was estimated at $1,894M. Descope options would include removing the satellite tour, with an estimated cost savings of $26M mostly due to operations and Deep Space Network cost savings realized by reducing the mission by 14 months. The second option would be to reduce to the floor payload on both the probe and orbiter, with an estimated savings of $120M in instrument development cost. Finally, the entry probe could be descoped with a savings of $310M in probe development, integration and testing, and operations costs.\nOverall, the study has developed a concept that can achieve very robust science at Uranus at a cost below flagship mission levels and with minimal required technology development.\nAn additional Mission Concept Study is also available for Neptune-Triton-Kuiper Belt Objects, final report.\n","date":1270239282,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1270239282,"objectID":"920f4879a2a0666a58f2b6dce110ab85","permalink":"https://ice-giants.github.io/post/planetary-decadal-2013/","publishdate":"2010-04-02T21:14:42+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/planetary-decadal-2013/","section":"post","summary":"Uranus and Neptune components of the US Planetary Decadal Survey 2013.","tags":[],"title":"US Planetary Decadal Survey 2013-2022","type":"post"}]
