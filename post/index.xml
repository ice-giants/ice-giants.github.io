      <description>COSPAR Symposium B5.4 â€“ Wednesday July 18th 2018 Ice Giant Systems: New Results and Future Exploration MSO: Leigh Fletcher (Univ. of Leicester) DSO: Amy Simon (Goddard Spaceflight Center)
COSPAR sub-commission B5 hosted several symposia focussing on the exploration of the outer solar system at the 2018 COSPAR meeting in Pasadena, ranging from the highlights of past missions (Cassini), active missions (Juno), and future missions (exploration of ocean worlds). The ice giant community met on Wednesday afternoon to focus on the exploration of Uranus and Neptune, from their interiors, to their atmospheres, magnetospheres, rings and satellite systems.</description>

      <description>The Ice Giants Study was commissioned by NASA to take a fresh look at science priorities and concepts for missions to the Uranus and Neptune systems in preparation for the third Planetary Science Decadal Survey. The study team assessed and prioritised science objectives taking into account advances since the last Decadal Survey, current and emerging technologies, mission implementation techniques and celestial mechanics. This study examined a wide range of mission architectures, flight elements, and instruments.</description>
